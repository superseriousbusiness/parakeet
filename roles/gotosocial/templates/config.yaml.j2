##### GENERAL CONFIG ######
###########################

# String. Log level to use throughout the application. Must be lower-case.
# Options: ["trace","debug","info","warn","error","fatal"]
# Default: "info"
log-level: "info"

# Bool. Log database queries when log-level is set to debug or trace.
# This setting produces verbose logs, so it's better to only enable it
# when you're trying to track an issue down.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
log-db-queries: false

# String. Application name to use internally.
# Examples: ["My Application","gotosocial"]
# Default: "gotosocial"
application-name: "gotosocial"

# String. The user that will be shown instead of the landing page. if no user is set, the landing page will be shown.
# Examples: "admin"
# Default: ""
landing-page-user: ""

# String. Hostname that this server will be reachable at. Defaults to localhost for local testing,
# but you should *definitely* change this when running for real, or your server won't work at all.
# DO NOT change this after your server has already run once, or you will break things!
# Examples: ["gts.example.org","some.server.com"]
# Default: "localhost"
host: "{{ gotosocial_hostname }}"

# String. Domain to use when federating profiles. This is useful when you want your server to be at
# eg., "gts.example.org", but you want the domain on accounts to be "example.org" because it looks better
# or is just shorter/easier to remember.
#
# To make this setting work properly, you need to redirect requests at "example.org/.well-known/webfinger"
# to "gts.example.org/.well-known/webfinger" so that GtS can handle them properly.
#
# You should also redirect requests at "example.org/.well-known/nodeinfo" in the same way.
# An empty string (ie., not set) means that the same value as 'host' will be used.
#
# DO NOT change this after your server has already run once, or you will break things!
#
# Please read the appropriate section of the installation guide before you go messing around with this setting:
# https://docs.gotosocial.org/installation_guide/advanced/#can-i-host-my-instance-at-fediexampleorg-but-have-just-exampleorg-in-my-username
#
# Examples: ["example.org","server.com"]
# Default: ""
account-domain: "{{ domain }}"

# String. Protocol to use for the server. Only change to http for local testing!
# This should be the protocol part of the URI that your server is actually reachable on. So even if you're
# running GoToSocial behind a reverse proxy that handles SSL certificates for you, instead of using built-in
# letsencrypt, it should still be https.
# Options: ["http","https"]
# Default: "https"
protocol: "https"

# String. Address to bind the GoToSocial server to.
# This can be an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address (surrounded in square brackets), or a hostname.
# Default value will bind to all interfaces.
# You probably won't need to change this unless you're setting GoToSocial up in some fancy way or
# you have specific networking requirements.
# Examples: ["0.0.0.0", "172.128.0.16", "localhost", "[::]", "[2001:db8::fed1]"]
# Default: "0.0.0.0"
bind-address: "0.0.0.0"

# Int. Listen port for the GoToSocial webserver + API. If you're running behind a reverse proxy and/or in a docker,
# container, just set this to whatever you like (or leave the default), and make sure it's forwarded properly.
# If you are running with built-in letsencrypt enabled, and running GoToSocial directly on a host machine, you will
# probably want to set this to 443 (standard https port), unless you have other services already using that port.
# This *MUST NOT* be the same as the letsencrypt port specified below, unless letsencrypt is turned off.
# Examples: [443, 6666, 8080]
# Default: 8080
port: 8080

# Array of string. CIDRs or IP addresses of proxies that should be trusted when determining real client IP from behind a reverse proxy.
# If you're running inside a Docker container behind Traefik or Nginx, for example, add the subnet of your docker network,
# or the gateway of the docker network, and/or the address of the reverse proxy (if it's not running on the host network).
# Example: ["127.0.0.1/32", "172.20.0.1"]
# Default: ["127.0.0.1/32"] (localhost)
trusted-proxies:
  - "127.0.0.1/32"
  - "{{ docker_ipam_configs.gotosocial.gateway }}"

############################
##### DATABASE CONFIG ######
############################

# Config pertaining to the Gotosocial database connection

# String. Database type.
# Options: ["postgres","sqlite"]
# Default: "postgres"
db-type: "postgres"

# String. Database address or parameters.
#
# For Postgres, this should be the address or socket at which the database can be reached.
#
# For Sqlite, this should be the path to your sqlite database file. Eg., /opt/gotosocial/sqlite.db.
# If the file doesn't exist at the specified path, it will be created.
# If just a filename is provided (no directory) then the database will be created in the same directory
# as the GoToSocial binary.
# If address is set to :memory: then an in-memory database will be used (no file).
# WARNING: :memory: should NOT BE USED except for testing purposes.
#
# Examples: ["localhost","my.db.host","127.0.0.1","192.111.39.110",":memory:", "sqlite.db"]
# Default: ""
db-address: "{{ container_addresses.postgres }}"

# Int. Port for database connection.
# Examples: [5432, 1234, 6969]
# Default: 5432
db-port: 5432

# String. Username for the database connection.
# Examples: ["mydbuser","postgres","gotosocial"]
# Default: "postgres"
db-user: "{{ gotosocial_postgres_user }}"

# String. Password to use for the database connection
# Examples: ["password123","verysafepassword","postgres"]
# Default: ""
db-password: "{{ gotosocial_postgres_password }}"

# String. Name of the database to use within the provided database type.
# Examples: ["mydb","postgres","gotosocial"]
# Default: "postgres"
db-database: "{{ gotosocial_postgres_db }}"

# String. Disable, enable, or require SSL/TLS connection to the database.
# If "disable" then no TLS connection will be attempted.
# If "enable" then TLS will be tried, but the database certificate won't be checked (for self-signed certs).
# If "require" then TLS will be required to make a connection, and a valid certificate must be presented.
# Options: ["disable", "enable", "require"]
# Default: "disable"
db-tls-mode: "require"

# String. Path to a CA certificate on the host machine for db certificate validation.
# If this is left empty, just the host certificates will be used.
# If filled in, the certificate will be loaded and added to host certificates.
# Examples: ["/path/to/some/cert.crt"]
# Default: ""
db-tls-ca-cert: "{{ gotosocial_ca_cert_path }}"

# Int. Number to multiply by CPU count to set permitted total of open database connections (in-use and idle).
# You can use this setting to tune your database connection behavior, though most admins won't need to touch it.
#
# Example values for multiplier 8:
#
# 1 cpu = 08 open connections
# 2 cpu = 16 open connections
# 4 cpu = 32 open connections
#
# Example values for multiplier 4:
#
# 1 cpu = 04 open connections
# 2 cpu = 08 open connections
# 4 cpu = 16 open connections
#
# A multiplier of 8 is a sensible default, but you may wish to increase this for instances
# running on very performant hardware, or decrease it for instances using v. slow CPUs.
#
# If you set the multiplier to less than 1, only one open connection will be used regardless of cpu count.
#
# PLEASE NOTE!!: This setting currently only applies for Postgres. SQLite will always use 1 connection regardless
# of what is set here. This behavior will change in future when we implement better SQLITE_BUSY handling.
# See https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues/1407 for more details.
#
# Examples: [16, 8, 10, 2]
# Default: 8
db-max-open-conns-multiplier: 8

# String. SQLite journaling mode.
# SQLite only -- unused otherwise.
# If set to empty string, the sqlite default will be used.
# See: https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode
# Examples: ["DELETE", "TRUNCATE", "PERSIST", "MEMORY", "WAL", "OFF"]
# Default: "WAL"
db-sqlite-journal-mode: "WAL"

# String. SQLite synchronous mode.
# SQLite only -- unused otherwise.

# Default: "NORMAL"
db-sqlite-synchronous: "NORMAL"

# Byte size. SQlite cache size.
# SQLite only -- unused otherwise.
# If set to empty string or zero, the sqlite default (2MiB) will be used.
# See: https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size
# Examples: ["0", "2MiB", "8MiB", "64MiB"]
# Default: "8MiB"
db-sqlite-cache-size: "8MiB"

# Duration. SQlite busy timeout.
# SQLite only -- unused otherwise.
# If set to empty string or zero, the sqlite default will be used.
# See: https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_busy_timeout
# Examples: ["0s", "1s", "30s", "1m", "5m"]
# Default: "5s"
db-sqlite-busy-timeout: "5m"

cache:
  # Cache configuration options:
  #
  # max-size   = maximum cached objects count
  # ttl        = cached object lifetime
  # sweep-freq = frequency to look for stale cache objects

# Config pertaining to instance federation settings, pages to hide/expose, etc.

# Bool. Allow unauthenticated users to make queries to /api/v1/instance/peers?filter=open in order
# to see a list of instances that this instance 'peers' with. Even if set to 'false', then authenticated
# users (members of the instance) will still be able to query the endpoint.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
instance-expose-peers: true

# Bool. Allow unauthenticated users to make queries to /api/v1/instance/peers?filter=suspended in order
# to see a list of instances that this instance blocks/suspends. This will also allow unauthenticated
# users to see the list through the web UI. Even if set to 'false', then authenticated users (members
# of the instance) will still be able to query the endpoint.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
instance-expose-suspended: false

# Bool. Allow unauthenticated users to view /about/suspended,
# showing the HTML rendered list of instances that this instance blocks/suspends.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
instance-expose-suspended-web: false

# Bool. Allow unauthenticated users to make queries to /api/v1/timelines/public in order
# to see a list of public posts on this server. Even if set to 'false', then authenticated
# users (members of the instance) will still be able to query the endpoint.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
instance-expose-public-timeline: false

# Bool. This flag tweaks whether GoToSocial will deliver ActivityPub messages
# to the shared inbox of a recipient, if one is available, instead of delivering
# each message to each actor who should receive a message individually.
#
# Shared inbox delivery can significantly reduce network load when delivering
# to multiple recipients share an inbox (eg., on large Mastodon instances).
#
# See: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#shared-inbox-delivery
#
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: true
instance-deliver-to-shared-inboxes: true

###########################
##### ACCOUNTS CONFIG #####
###########################

# Config pertaining to creation and maintenance of accounts on the server, as well as defaults for new accounts.

# Bool. Do we want people to be able to just submit sign up requests, or do we want invite only?
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: true

# Bool. Are sign up requests required to submit a reason for the request (eg., an explanation of why they want to join the instance)?
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: true
accounts-reason-required: true

# Bool. Allow accounts on this instance to set custom CSS for their profile pages and statuses.
# Enabling this setting will allow accounts to upload custom CSS via the /user settings page,
# which will then be rendered on the web view of the account's profile and statuses.
#
# For instances with public sign ups, it is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to leave this setting on 'false',
# since setting it to true allows malicious accounts to make their profile pages misleading, unusable
# or even dangerous to visitors. In other words, you should only enable this setting if you trust
# the users on your instance not to produce harmful CSS.
#
# Regardless of what this value is set to, any uploaded CSS will not be federated to other instances,
# it will only be shown on profiles and statuses on *this* instance.
#
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
accounts-allow-custom-css: true

########################
##### MEDIA CONFIG #####
########################

# A job will run every day at midnight to clean up any remote media older than the given amount of days.
#
# When remote media is removed from the cache, it is deleted from storage but the database entries for the media
# are kept so that it can be fetched again if requested by a user.
#
# If this is set to 0, then media from remote instances will be cached indefinitely.
# Examples: [30, 60, 7, 0]
# Default: 30
media-remote-cache-days: 5

# Int. Max size in bytes of emojis uploaded to this instance via the admin API.
# The default is the same as the Mastodon size limit for emojis (50kb), which allows

#
# The bucket must exist prior to starting GoToSocial
#
# Only required when running with the s3 storage backend.
# Examples: ["gts","cool-instance"]
# Default: ""
storage-s3-bucket: ""

###########################
##### STATUSES CONFIG #####
###########################

# Config pertaining to the creation of statuses/posts, and permitted limits.

# Int. Maximum amount of characters permitted for a new status.

# Options: [true, false]
# Default: true
letsencrypt-enabled: false

# Int. Port to listen for letsencrypt certificate challenges on.
# If letsencrypt is enabled, this port must be reachable or you won't be able to obtain certs.

# Bool. Link OIDC authenticated users to existing ones based on their email address.
# This is mostly intended for migration purposes if you were running previous versions of GTS
# which only correlated users with their email address. Should be set to false for most usecases.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false

#######################
##### SMTP CONFIG #####
#######################

# Config for sending emails via an smtp server. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol

# String. The hostname of the smtp server you want to use.
# If this is not set, smtp will not be used to send emails, and you can ignore the other settings.
# Examples: ["mail.example.org", "localhost"]
# Default: ""
smtp-host: "{{ smtp_host }}"

# Int. Port to use to connect to the smtp server.
# Examples: []
# Default: 0
smtp-port: {{ smtp_port }}

# String. Username to use when authenticating with the smtp server.
# This should have been provided to you by your smtp host.
# This is often, but not always, an email address.
# Examples: ["maillord@example.org"]
# Default: ""
smtp-username: "{{ smtp_username }}"

# String. Password to use when authenticating with the smtp server.
# This should have been provided to you by your smtp host.
# Examples: ["1234", "password"]
# Default: ""
smtp-password: "{{ smtp_password }}"

# String. 'From' address for sent emails.
# Examples: ["mail@example.org"]
# Default: ""
smtp-from: "{{ admin_email_address }}"

# Bool. If true, when an email is sent that has multiple recipients, each recipient
# will be included in the To field, so that each recipient can see who else got the
# email, and they can 'reply all' to the other recipients if they want to.
#
# If false, email will be sent to Undisclosed Recipients, and each recipient will not
# be able to see who else received the email.
#
# It might be useful to change this setting to 'true' if you want to be able to discuss
# new moderation reports with other admins by 'replying-all' to the notification email.
# Default: false
smtp-disclose-recipients: false

#########################
##### SYSLOG CONFIG #####
#########################

# Config for additional syslog log hooks. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog,
# and https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/tree/master/hooks/syslog.
#
# These settings are useful when one wants to daemonize GoToSocial and send logs
# to a specific place, either a local location or a syslog server. Most users will
# not need to touch these settings.

# Bool. Enable the syslog logging hook. Logs will be mirrored to the configured destination.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
syslog-enabled: false

# String. Protocol to use when directing logs to syslog. Leave empty to connect to local syslog.
# Options: ["udp", "tcp", ""]
# Default: "tcp"
syslog-protocol: "udp"

# String. Address:port to send syslog logs to. Leave empty to connect to local syslog.
# Default: "localhost:514"
syslog-address: "localhost:514"

##################################
##### OBSERVABILITY SETTINGS #####
##################################

# String. Header name to use to extract a request or trace ID from. Typically set by a
# loadbalancer or proxy.
# Default: "X-Request-Id"
request-id-header: "X-Request-Id"

#############################
##### ADVANCED SETTINGS #####
#############################

# Advanced settings pertaining to http timeouts, security, cookies, and more.
#
# ONLY ADJUST THESE SETTINGS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
#
# Most users will not need to (and should not) touch these settings, since
# they are set to sensible defaults, and may break if they are changed.
#
# Nevertheless, they are provided for the sake of allowing server admins to
# tweak their instance for performance or security reasons.

# String. Value of the SameSite attribute of cookies set by GoToSocial.
# Defaults to 'lax' to ensure that the OIDC flow does not break, which is
# fine in most cases. If you want to harden your instance against CSRF attacks
# and don't mind if some login-related things might break, you can set this
# to 'strict' instead.
#
# For an overview of what this does, see:
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite
#
# Options: ["lax", "strict"]
# Default: "lax"
advanced-cookies-samesite: "lax"

# Int. Amount of requests to permit per router grouping from a single IP address within
# a span of 5 minutes. If this amount is exceeded, a 429 HTTP error code will be returned.
#
# If you find yourself adjusting this limit because it's regularly being exceeded,
# you should first verify that your settings for `trusted-proxies` (above) are correct.
# In many cases, when the rate limit is exceeded it is because your instance sees all
# incoming requests as coming from the *same IP address* (you can verify this by looking
# at the client IPs in your instance logs). If this is the case, try adding that IP
# address to your `trusted-proxies` *BEFORE* you go adjusting this rate limit setting!
#
# If you set this to 0 or less, rate limiting will be disabled entirely.
#
# Examples: [1000, 500, 0]
# Default: 300
advanced-rate-limit-requests: 300

# Int. Amount of open requests to permit per CPU, per router grouping, before applying http
# request throttling. Any requests beyond the calculated limit are held in a backlog queue for
# up to 30 seconds before either being processed or timing out. Requests that don't fit in the backlog
# queue will have status 503 returned to them, and the header 'Retry-After' will be set to 30 seconds.
#
# Open request limit is available CPUs * multiplier; backlog queue limit is limit * multiplier.
#
# Example values for multiplier 8:
#
# 1 cpu = 08 open, 064 backlog
# 2 cpu = 16 open, 128 backlog
# 4 cpu = 32 open, 256 backlog
#
# Example values for multiplier 4:
#
# 1 cpu = 04 open, 016 backlog
# 2 cpu = 08 open, 032 backlog
# 4 cpu = 16 open, 064 backlog
#
# A multiplier of 8 is a sensible default, but you may wish to increase this for instances
# running on very performant hardware, or decrease it for instances using v. slow CPUs.
#
# If you set this to 0 or less, http request throttling will be disabled entirely.
#
# Examples: [8, 4, 9, 0]
# Default: 8
advanced-throttling-multiplier: 8

# Duration. Time period to use as the "retry-after" header value in response to throttled requests.
# Minimum resolution is 1 second.
#
# Examples: [30s, 10s, 5s, 1m]
# Default: 30s
advanced-throttling-retry-after: "5s"
