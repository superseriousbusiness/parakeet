##### GENERAL CONFIG ######
###########################
# String. Log level to use throughout the application. Must be lower-case.
# Options: ["trace","debug","info","warn","error","fatal"]
# Default: "info"
logLevel: "info"

# String. Application name to use internally.
# Examples: ["My Application","gotosocial"]
# Default: "gotosocial"
applicationName: "gotosocial"

# String. Hostname that this server will be reachable at. Defaults to localhost for local testing,
# but you should *definitely* change this when running for real, or your server won't work at all.
# DO NOT change this after your server has already run once, or you will break things!
# Examples: ["gts.example.org","some.server.com"]
# Default: "localhost"
host: "{{ gotosocial_hostname }}"

# String. Domain to use when federating profiles. This is useful when you want your server to be at
# eg., "gts.example.org", but you want the domain on accounts to be "example.org" because it looks better
# or is just shorter/easier to remember.
# To make this setting work properly, you need to redirect requests at "example.org/.well-known/webfinger"
# to "gts.example.org/.well-known/webfinger" so that GtS can handle them properly.
# You should also redirect requests at "example.org/.well-known/nodeinfo" in the same way.
# An empty string (ie., not set) means that the same value as 'host' will be used.
# DO NOT change this after your server has already run once, or you will break things!
# Examples: ["example.org","server.com"]
# Default: ""
accountDomain: "{{ domain }}"

# String. Protocol to use for the server. Only change to http for local testing!

  # like Traefik, HAProxy, or Nginx.
  # Options: [true, false]
  # Default: true 
  enabled: false

  # String. Directory in which to store LetsEncrypt certificates.
  # It is a good move to make this a sub-path within your storage directory, as it makes

  # Default: "/gotosocial/storage/certs"
